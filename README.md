# People's Open Shell Interface
This is an interface to run a collection of scripts to adjust settings on your People's Open Node.   
Adapted from Daniel Aruz's [Wifi Scripts for MacOS](https://github.com/wwwhtml/wifi-scripts-for-macos)  

Keep all these files in the same directory if you want to run them from the Menu. 
To get to the Menu run the menu.sh script. All scripts can run independenly as well.

 4) Remove a Preferred WiFi Network
 5) Remove all Preferred Wifi Network
 6) Move an SSID to Top
 7) Scan for WiFi Networks
 8) Enter Shell
 8) Quit
